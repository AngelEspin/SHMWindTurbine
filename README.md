# SHMWindTurbine
This repository contains the code and data from my research at SDU, where I developed an algorithm for diagnosing damage in wind turbines. The project applied machine learning techniques, including K-means Clustering, Naive Bayes, and KNN, to classify power spectral densities (PSD) and detect structural damage based on specific frequency bands.
